Generate C++ classes from configuration files written in TOML markup.
Automatically generate code for serialization and deserialization in
different markup languages:

+ XML to/from using Qt's xml tooling (generate SAX parser). Use of the
  BOOST xml handling facilities is theoretically possible too but not
  currently in the scope of interest
+ Json to/from using nlohmann json library.

Automatically generate wrapper code to use the generated classes in
perl, python and nim.
