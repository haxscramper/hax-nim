Collection of libraries and tools written in nim that I use
in different projects

- colecho :: colorful command-line echo alternative with support for
  formating output. Supports multiple styles and message levels
  (debug, warn, error, log)
- hargparse :: *very* simple command-line options parser with support
  for automatic generation of help messages. It is a very hack-ish
  library - it will be supreseded by ~hargparse2~ at some point (see
  =hargparse2/devnotes.org= for complete list of planned features).
- create_script :: command-line utiltity to automate create of scripts
  and simple programs. Development temprarily paused
- hmisc :: miscelaneous helper functions/types
- parse_path :: cli tool to simplify parsing file/directory paths
- scripts :: misc cli utilities
